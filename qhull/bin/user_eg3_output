user_eg3 -- demonstrate calling rbox and qhull from C++.

user_eg3 is statically linked to reentrant qhull.  If user_eg3
fails immediately, it is probably linked to the non-reentrant qhull.
Try 'user_eg3 rbox qhull "T1"'

  eg-100                       Run the example in qh-code.htm
  rbox "200 D4" ...            Generate points from rbox
  qhull "d p" ...              Run qhull and produce output
  qhull-cout "o" ...           Run qhull and produce output to cout
  qhull "T1" ...               Run qhull with level-1 trace to cerr
  facets                       Print facets when done

For example
  user_eg3 rbox qhull
  user_eg3 rbox qhull d
  user_eg3 rbox "10 D2"  "2 D2" qhull  "s p" facets
