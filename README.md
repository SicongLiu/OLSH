* Synthetic Data Generator: We modified the original implementation from original github folder: https://github.com/sofiabravo103/builder, and the revised version of synthetic data generator is listed in this github repository as Synthetic_Data_Gen.cpp


CodeBase
--------

We adopted the implemention of Simple LSH from paper[2] of 2018 SIGKDD, with github link: https://github.com/HuangQiang/H2_ALSH
